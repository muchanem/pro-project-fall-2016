# Pro Project Peers

There are no TAs for Pro. You are each others' TAs. It is important
that you contribute in a positive way to each others projects and
learning. Following your Pro peers to get you started.

## Follow Peers

To follow, first learn their GitHub names in class or from the web
site. Then go to their GitHub profile and click the *Follow* button.
You may wish to follow Pro peers from other classes as well. Classes
are just a regular time to meet weekly, consider yourself part of
a larger group than just the peers you meet with on a particular class
day.

## Peer Review

*Peer Review* is an ongoing assignment—with two specific deadline
dates—to help you get ideas, share your own, and become proficient
with the [GitHub Issues][issues] system. 

Keep in mind that, although Pro (nor any SkilStak offering) has no
grades—the quality of your feedback will be taken into consideration
when Pro invite decisions are being made later. The better your
review, the more it will weigh positively on a decision to invite
you again.

Also, if you have feedback or a suggestion about this Pro course in
general please open an issue on the SkilStak repo (that your forked)
so we can have a record of your ideas. As usual, the students are the
best source of ideas on how to make SkilStak even better.

### Initial 

To complete the *Initial Peer Review* assignment read through your
peers' project [plans](plan.md) and find one that you would like
to give some constructive feedback or initial suggestions. Click
on the `Issues` for the project and find the one titled *Peer Review*
(if it is not there let them know immediately). Add a comment to
that issue with your feedback and suggestions.

### Final

To complete the *Final Peer Review* assignment read through your
peers project [reports](report.md) and find some constructive feedback
or final suggestions to give. Add a comment to the *Peer Review* issue
