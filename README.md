# SkilStak Pro Project Documentation - Fall 2016

Welcome to Fall SkilStak Pro 2016 and congrats on getting an invite.
Here's how Pro works.

* Create a project documentation repo by forking this repo
* Check the [schedule](schedule.md) to know when things are due
* Be professional and responsible

It is important that you keep your project documentation up to date
since this is how you and everyone else keeps track of your project.

* [Schedule, Deadlines, Log](schedule.md)
* [Project Plan](plan.md)
* [Peer Review](peers.md)
* [Final Report](report.md)

## Three Strikes

Pro carries a higher standard of personal responsibility and
professionalism than our other offerings at SkilStak. In fact, the
primary goal of Pro is to help instill professional habits and build
profiles and project work to demonstrate what you know to others.

While we strive for a casual Google-meets-Berkley atmosphere and realize
there is a higher level of socialization during classes because you
have been working on your projects from home, we still need to
ensure everyone holds the same standard of professionalism. To do
that we have a pretty strict three strikes policy. Any of the
following will get you a strike:

* Missing any deadline
* Using not suitable-for-work language, videos, etc.
* Pranks or bullying of any kind, even in fun
* Disrespect for the instructor, mentors, or other students 

If any of these happens there won't be a lot of conversation about
it, you'll just get taken aside and informed and your parents will
be contacted.

There, enough about that.

## Project Completion

**You must complete your project during the course or you will lose
your Pro invite for the next course.** How will you know you are
complete:

* Does it feel polished
* Would you feel comfortable linking to it from your resume or
  LinkedIn?
* How do you feel about showing it to your friend, parents, or boss?

Sometimes you may have gotten the scope of your project wrong at the
start and need some help from your instructor to adjust the amount
of work for your project. This is normal, but work hard to set
realistic objectives.

Thanks,
Mr. Rob
